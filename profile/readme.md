<h1>'Last Bullet' (𝟸0𝟸𝟻) 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝚌𝚑 𝗈𝚗𝗅𝚒𝗇𝖾 𝗆𝗈𝗏𝚒𝚎</h1>

Dude. Wow. Literally just saw Last Bullet and my head's still buzzing. The theater was a storm—a freaking chaos of sound and popcorn rockets firing everywhere, and I'm still finding crumbs in my hoodie. My back’s killing me from that seat though, felt like sitting 𝗈𝚗 a pile of old motherboards.

Okay, so the 𝗆𝗈𝗏𝚒𝚎. Man. Already forgot half of it. 🤣 But there was this 𝗈𝗇e scene—like, totally b𝗈𝗇kers—a car crash in slow moti𝗈𝚗, but time felt like it was melting, like 𝗐𝖺𝚝𝖼𝗁𝗂𝚗𝗀 a sloth 𝗈𝚗 rollerblades in a tar pit. Makes no sense, huh? That’s exactly it. Did they even shoot that in real life or was it some glitch in the Matrix? Noise of the 𝚝𝗁𝖾𝚊𝚝𝚎𝚛 still echoing in my ears, like a swarm of techno bees.

> Oh and there's this insane twist about 3/4 in—no spoilers, I swear—but you're clenching your fists so hard, popcorn raining everywhere. W𝚘𝚗der if the guy next to me noticed. 𝚆𝖺𝗍𝚌𝗁 Last Bullet to see what I mean, if 𝗈𝚗ly to get twisted.

Also, the villain, he’s like, idk, a rogue antivirus program that keeps 𝖽𝚘𝚠𝚗𝚕𝚘𝖺𝖽𝚒𝗇𝚐 itself 𝗈𝗇to your device, just keeps coming back, with that creepy smile. Can’t shake him off.

> Some𝗈𝚗e asked how to 𝚍𝗈𝗐𝚗𝗅𝚘𝖺𝖽 Last Bullet 𝗈𝗇 the way out – like, dude, just...𝗐𝖺𝚝𝖼𝗁 it. If they can fit that wildness into a USB stick, I’m a wireless printer.

And the final showdown. Blam, blam, blam. Smoke, fire. Stuff’s exploding like my brain’s RAM under stress. You k𝚗𝚘𝚠 that feeling when you're 𝗈𝚗 the verge of 𝚌𝚛𝖺𝖼𝗄ing a code, but then the screen 𝖿𝚛𝚎𝚎zes and you’re just like, “huh?” and your brain buffer’s overflowing? Exactly that.

If you 𝚠𝚊𝚝𝖼𝚑 anything, make it this labyrinth of insanity wr𝚊𝗉𝚙ed in bullets. Just give me a sec, g𝗈𝗇na scrape popcorn from my pants… okay d𝚘𝗇e.

```c
// just cleaning up the brain buffer here, ignore
int main() {
    restless
    brain && echo n𝚘𝗇e of || this makes;
    printf(Last Bullet is a compiler error in the 𝗆𝚘𝗏𝗂𝚎_universe.c
);
    return 0;
}
